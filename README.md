# Look at template
- https://hugo-fresh.vercel.app/ this is a live demo of how the complete template looks like

# Set up Hugo and template locally
- install hugo from https://gohugo.io/installation/
- I installed template like this: https://stefma.github.io/hugo-fresh/getstarted/

# Work with the template
- basically change the main `yaml` file
- start `hugo server` on the root
- do any changes, it should auto-reload in the browser
